Basic blog structure is set up.

I'm primarily going to be posting about incremental games and/or scripts to use
with them.  There are a few things I still need to fine tune.

- Decide on finalized theme colors.  I don't dislike the current but might
  change it still.
- Fix home page.  Currently showing a list of posts rather than an actuall
  welcome page.  This needs to change once I have better content to include.
- Update about page.  Currently it's a placeholder but will have information
  included.
